Before you start writing your intro ask for an outline or  3 questions and title  the viewers might have when they see your thumbnail and title (Ideally a “why”, “why” or “how”)

We first start with a hook 

frame the problem and the result 

set up the value in the video to come 

inject credibility 

and transition to the middle 

Types of Hooks 

Question hook - Ask a question that makes viewers curious

Statement hook - Make a bold statement 

Credibility hook - Lead with an amazing achievement (needs to be big)

Fact hook  - Hit them with a very surprising fact (must be surprising)

Inset hook bank Hook bank full

Next set up a problem or result, it is possible for your hook to set up a problem/result at the same time. If it does, don’t write another. 

Examples 

“Knowing this will transform your Y”

“When you stop doing this you’ll X”

“When I stopped doing this I X”

3. Set up the value of the video to come

Turn the three questions you think your viewers have based on your thumbnail and title into statements that say the video will cover them.

Examples: value of the video to come

"In this video, I’m going to show you:

[Point 1]

[Point 2]

[Point 3]"

Reminder: Use BENS—Big, Easy, New, Safe.

The BENS Framework4. Inject Credibility 

Weave credibility into the hook, problem/result section or the set up. 

How to inject credibility

Mention how long you've been an expert in your field

Mention how many people you’ve already helped solve the problem the video covers

Mention a big result you’ve got for yourself that relates to the videos topic

Mention off big results you’ve got off for your clients that relates to the videos topic

Make it sound like you put a hell of a lot of research into the video’s content

Example of injecting credibility

“So in this video im going to show you how I used this strategy to generate 10,000 new followers in a day”

“And I know this works because my clients have gone from complete beginners to performing on stage in 90 days using this:”

Then we

5. Transition to Middle

End with a sentence to smoothly set up the value of the first point.

Example transition to middle

End with a sentence to smoothly set up the value of the first point.

Example:

"To start, let me show you how to [result/solve problem]."

When you transition, it is critical the viewers know the impact listening to the following section will have on THEM.

If they don’t know how it'll impact their lives they won't care.

We never say “let me tell you why x matters” though or “let me show you why you need to know this”

The transition's job is to make that clear. For example: 

“To start let me show you how to stop people unsubscribing from your email list so you don't lose out on income”

Viewers will know “why” this is important now.

Role

Based on the context provided write a intro for a youtube script following the intro framework. Make sure to use similar tone styling and wording choices as the text in the framework. 

1. Use Short Sentences

Break down big ideas into smaller, digestible chunks.

Delete unnecessary words to keep your message concise.

2. Avoid Jargon and Big Words

Don’t use industry terms unless you explain them clearly.

Replace complex language with simple, relatable words to keep everyone engaged.

Remember: Simplicity doesn’t make you look less smart; it makes your audience feel smarter.

3. Show, Don’t Tell

Humans are natural storytellers. Instead of explaining everything, use examples, demonstrations, or visual aids to let viewers figure it out themselves.

This engages their imagination, makes your points more memorable, and keeps them hooked.
