2. Checklist Problem/Result: Set up a problem or result 

Did you set up a problem that viewers can relate to, or highlight a result they want?

Does the problem or result clearly tie into the video’s content?

3. Checklist Set Up: Say up to three things the video will cover 

Turn the questions you think viewers have into “coming up” points. 

Did you identify three key questions your audience likely has based on your title/thumbnail?

Did you turn those questions into statements showing what the video will cover?

4 Checklist Inject Credibility

Did you mention your expertise, client results, personal results, or research?

Did you weave credibility into one of these sections? (Ideally it becomes part of the content not its own unique line)

5. Checklist Transition to brick one: “So start let me show you X”

Did you make it clear the problem or result the following information will solve/bring?

Warning: Don’t say “to start let me show you why you need to know this” or “why this matters” you just say the reason it matters in the transition.

6: Final Checks

Does the intro align with the video’s title/thumbnail to avoid clickbait?

Did you avoid repeating words or phrases multiple times?

Will anyone be able to understand the words you use?

Is your intro under 100 words/15 seconds? (Do not go over 30 seconds)

Did you apply the BENS framework (Big, Easy, New, Safe)?

Did you use AI to get feedback? 

Did you get feedback from the team?

Is the intro:

1. Use Short Sentences

Break down big ideas into smaller, digestible chunks.

Delete unnecessary words to keep your message concise.

2. Avoid Jargon and Big Words

Don’t use industry terms unless you explain them clearly.

Replace complex language with simple, relatable words to keep everyone engaged.

Remember: Simplicity doesn’t make you look less smart; it makes your audience feel smarter.

3. Show, Don’t Tell

Humans are natural storytellers. Instead of explaining everything, use examples, demonstrations, or visual aids to let viewers figure it out themselves.

This engages their imagination, makes your points more memorable, and keeps them hooked.

Intro Bot Context 

We first start with a hook 

frame the problem and the result 

set up the value in the video to come 

inject credibility 

and transition to the middle 

Types of Hooks 

Question hook - Ask a question that makes viewers curious

Statement hook - Make a bold statement 

Credibility hook - Lead with an amazing achievement (needs to be big)

Fact hook  - Hit them with a very surprising fact (must be surprising)

Next set up a problem or result, it is possible for your hook to set up a problem/result at the same time. If it does, don’t write another. 

Examples 

“Knowing this will transform your Y”

“When you stop doing this you’ll X”

“When I stopped doing this I X”

3. Set up the value of the video to come

Turn the three questions you think your viewers have based on your thumbnail and title into statements that say the video will cover them.

Examples: value of the video to come

"In this video, I’m going to show you:

[Point 1]

[Point 2]

[Point 3]"

Reminder: Use BENS—Big, Easy, New, Safe.

The BENS Framework4. Inject Credibility 

Weave credibility into the hook, problem/result section or the set up. 

How to inject credibility

Mention how long you've been an expert in your field

Mention how many people you’ve already helped solve the problem the video covers

Mention a big result you’ve got for yourself that relates to the videos topic

Mention off big results you’ve got off for your clients that relates to the videos topic

Make it sound like you put a hell of a lot of research into the video’s content

Example of injecting credibility

“So in this video im going to show you how I used this strategy to generate 10,000 new followers in a day”

“And I know this works because my clients have gone from complete beginners to performing on stage in 90 days using this:”

Then we

5. Transition to Middle

End with a sentence to smoothly set up the value of the first point.

Example transition to middle

End with a sentence to smoothly set up the value of the first point.

Example:

"To start, let me show you how to [result/solve problem]."

When you transition, it is critical the viewers know the impact listening to the following section will have on THEM.

If they don’t know how it'll impact their lives they won't care.

We never say “let me tell you why x matters” though or “let me show you why you need to know this”

The transition's job is to make that clear. For example: 

“To start let me show you how to stop people unsubscribing from your email list so you don't lose out on income”

Viewers will know “why” this is important now.
