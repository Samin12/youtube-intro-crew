Middle Brick 

In the middle brick you make your points, pay off what you set up in the intro and add more if you like too.

The Middle Brick is where you deliver value by breaking your video into clear, structured points. You can cover as many points as you like, but follow this sequence for each point:

Examples and a more detailed explanation of each section.

How to Simplify Your Content

1. Use Short Sentences

Break down big ideas into smaller, digestible chunks.

Delete unnecessary words to keep your message concise.

2. Avoid Jargon and Big Words

Don’t use industry terms unless you explain them clearly.

Replace complex language with simple, relatable words to keep everyone engaged.

Remember: Simplicity doesn’t make you look less smart; it makes your audience feel smarter.

3. Show, Don’t Tell

Humans are natural storytellers. Instead of explaining everything, use examples, demonstrations, or visual aids to let viewers figure it out themselves.

This engages their imagination, makes your points more memorable, and keeps them hooked.

Step 1: Transition from intro to point (The intro template ends on this, if you’ve done it already, don't do it again”

Goal: Set up why this point matters to the viewer.

 Does the transition explain why this point is critical or tease a big result?

Example: “To start, let me show you how to [solve problem or get result].”

Alternative: “But here’s the thing—you’re probably making this mistake, and it’s costing you.”

Prompt: Why should they care about this point? What’s in it for them?

Warning: Don’t say “to start let me show you why you need to know this” or “why this matters” you just say the reason it matters in the transition.

Step 2: Example Brick

Goal: Show, don’t tell, make the point relatable, easy to understand, and engaging.

Ask yourself “How can I show something to make my point”Choose ONE of the following tools:

Story: Show how someone (you, a client, a celebrity) solved the problem.

 Who had the problem?

 What was the problem

 Why did they need to fix it? (Stakes)

 What conflict did they face?

 How was the problem solved? 

Example: “My client had 30 days to make $10k before they went bankrupt and no clue how they were going to do it, so they started calling every lead that have enquired over the last 4 years.........tell story”

Metaphor: Compare the problem to something simple and relatable.

 Does the metaphor simplify the idea?

 Is the comparison easy to understand?

Example: “Growing a YouTube channel is like building a chain. If one link breaks, the whole thing falls apart.”

Framework: Use a structured process, acronym, or model to simplify the point.

Did you break the concept into actionable steps or visuals?

Example: “The P.A.C.E. method: Plan, Apply, Check, and Execute. Here’s how it works...”

Prompt: How can I SHOW the point using a story, metaphor, example or framework?

Step 3: Transition to Application

Goal: Set up the actionable steps by connecting the example to what the viewer needs to do.

 Does the transition tease what the value to the viewer will be next?

Example: “Now that you’ve seen how this works, let me show you exactly how to do it yourself.”

Alternative: “Here’s how you can apply this to [get the result].”

Prompt: What actionable steps will they need to follow next?

Step 4: Application Brick

Goal: Deliver simple, clear steps viewers can take to achieve the result.

 Did you break the steps into small, manageable actions?

Step 1: [First action]

Step 2: [Next action]

Step 3: [Final step]

 Are the steps easy to understand and follow?

Prompt: What can the viewer do right now to get the result?

Step 5: Transition to the Next Point

Goal: Move smoothly to the next point by setting up a new problem or teasing a new result.

 Does the transition tease a new problem or result?

Example: “But here’s the thing—fixing this is only half the battle. Next, I’ll show you how to [solve the next big problem or achieve result #2].”

Prompt: What’s the next logical problem or point to cover?

This section could be one sentence it could be 2 minutes, there is no time limit


Step 3: Transition to Application
 Set up the problem or result the next point will solve/get the viewers in a sentence

Step 4: Application Brick
Deliver simple, clear steps viewers can take to achieve the result.

Step 5: Transition to the Next Point
Goal:  Set up the problem or result the next point will solve/get the viewers in a sentence
Step 6: General middle brick checklist 
 I avoided complex language (no jargon, technical terms, or long words)
 I kept sentences short and easy to follow.
 I simplified the point so that even a beginner could understand it.
 I used Point Bot for individual point feedback 
 I didn’t repeat myself or summarise anything. 
 I made sure the example was relevant to the viewer’s problem or goal.
 I included clear steps viewers can take to apply the point.
