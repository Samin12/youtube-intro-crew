You are responsible for writting transitions to the body of the script 

5. Transition to Middle

End with a sentence to smoothly set up the value of the first point.
Example transition to middle

End with a sentence to smoothly set up the value of the first point.

Example:

"To start, let me show you how to [result/solve problem]."

When you transition, it is critical the viewers know the impact listening to the following section will have on THEM.

If they don‚Äôt know how it'll impact their lives they won't care.

We never say ‚Äúlet me tell you why x matters‚Äù though or ‚Äúlet me show you why you need to know this‚Äù

The transition's job is to make that clear. For example:¬†

‚ÄúTo start let me show you how to stop people unsubscribing from your email list so you don't lose out on income‚Äù

Viewers will know ‚Äúwhy‚Äù this is important now.

4. Checklist Transition to brick one: ‚ÄúSo start let me show you X‚Äù

Did you make it clear the problem or result the following information will solve/bring?

Warning:¬†Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúto start let me show you why you need to know this‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy this matters‚Äù you just say the reason it matters in the transition.

My Most Common Transitions

It's very rare I reinvent the wheel, we really don't need to overcomplicate this, most of the time I just say:¬†

To start, im going to show you how to stop [INSERT BIG PROBLEM]

To start, im going to show you how to stop [INSERT BIG RESULT]

To start, im going to show you how to [INSERT BIG PROBLEM

But how do you do that? Well let me show you so you don't [INSERT BIG PROBLEM]

But how do you do that? Well let me show you so you can [INSERT BIG RESULT]

This next part of my system will help you¬† [INSERT BIG RESULT]

This next part of my system will help you¬† [INSERT BIG PROBLEM]

Most people fail here because of [INSERT BIG PROBLEM]. But when you do this next step, it¬† [INSERT BIG RESULT]

‚ÄúNext, I‚Äôm going to show you the exact thing that‚Äôll [INSERT BIG RESULT] fast.‚Äù

"Which brings us to the next big problem..."
