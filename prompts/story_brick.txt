Stories are a powerful tool for making your examples engaging and memorable. They keep viewers hooked, explain concepts clearly, and show how problems are solved in a way that’s easy to understand. 

In this guide, we’ll explore the three types of stories you can use, how to tell them and how to transition seamlessly into the application section of your videos.

Why Are Stories So Powerful?
Engages the Brain: Stories activate regions in the brain responsible for sight, sound, taste, and movement, making information feel vivid and real.
Enhances Retention: Viewers remember stories better than raw information because they’re emotionally involved.
Builds Credibility: Stories show how you or others overcame challenges, proving your expertise without sounding like a sales pitch.
Simplifies Complex Ideas: A well-told story breaks down big concepts into relatable, easy-to-understand experiences.
Creates Transformation: Stories show growth, inspiring viewers to take action and solve their own problems.

The Basics of a Story
At its core, a story is about someone trying to solve a problem.
Relatability: The problem must resonate with your audience. If they don’t see themselves in the story, they won’t care.
Structure: Every great story has a beginning, middle, and end.

Why Stories Work in Examples
Retention: Stories often create the flattest parts of your retention graph, meaning viewers stay engaged.
Relatability: They connect with your audience by showing them how problems like theirs can be solved.
Clarity: Instead of explaining a concept, you demonstrate it through a narrative.

Story Structure: The Building Blocks
Each story should include:
Who: The person or character the story is about.
Problem: What problem are they trying to solve?
Why: Why is solving the problem critical? (This is where stakes come in.)
Conflict: The obstacles or challenges they faced.
Payoff: Did they get what they wanted and what they needed?
Finally, transition into the application section, where you explain how viewers can use the lesson in their own lives.

Types of Stories to Use in Examples
1. Fictional Stories
These are imagined scenarios designed to illustrate a point.
Example Breakdown:
Transition: “Now let me show you 5 game-changing ways to build trust and credibility fast in your videos.”
Story:
Who: You’re stuck in an elevator with Warren Buffet.
Problem: You want investment advice.
Why: He’s a financial genius, and you don’t want to waste the opportunity.
Conflict: He spends five minutes talking about his vacation instead.
Payoff: You still pay attention because of his credibility. He gives you what you want (a conversation) but not what you need (useful investment advice).
Application Transition: “But how do you build that kind of credibility in your videos?”

2. Stories About Others
These involve telling true stories about well-known people, companies, or events.
Example Breakdown:
Transition: “So what is this big mistake I'd say 99% of businesses make on YouTube?”
Story:
Who: Michael, the founder of Dollar Shave Club.
Problem: Razors were too expensive.
Why: He wanted to offer a cheaper solution to disrupt the market.
Conflict: Nobody believed a $1 razor could be good, and the business struggled.
Payoff: Michael created a viral ad campaign that made Dollar Shave Club famous. He got what he wanted (a successful product launch) and what he needed (proof that creativity could solve market skepticism).
Application Transition: “But how does this help you grow your YouTube channel?”
Pro Tip: Use unique, lesser-known stories to make your content stand out.

3. Personal Stories
These stories come from your own experiences, making them the most relatable and credible.
Example Breakdown:
Transition: “Have you ever wondered why your traffic suddenly drops for no reason? Well, let me tell you a story.”
Story:
Who: Me (Ed).
Problem: My sales plummeted after traffic dropped 90%.
Why: I needed to figure out why to keep my business afloat.
Conflict: After trying several fixes, I realized the problem was poor descriptions.
Payoff: I improved my descriptions, and sales rebounded. I got what I wanted (restored traffic) and what I needed (a better understanding of how to optimize descriptions).
Application Transition: “So how do you write descriptions that get more sales? Here’s how.”
Pro Tip: Don’t be afraid to share failures—they show your human side and build trust.

How to Transition Between Sections
From the Previous Point to the Story:
Tease the problem you’re about to solve.
Example: “So what’s the mistake you must avoid to grow your YouTube channel?”
From the Story to the Application:
Summarize the lesson from the story.
Tease the actionable steps viewers can take.
Example: “That’s the power of credibility—when people fully understand how useful you can be, they pay attention fast. But how do you do that?”

Common Mistakes to Avoid
Explaining the Point Before the Story:
Don’t say, “Credibility is important, let me explain why.” Instead, start with the story and let viewers draw the conclusion.
Dragging Out Stories:
Remove unnecessary details that don’t contribute to the payoff.
Weak Transitions:
A weak transition can lose viewers. Make sure your transitions clearly connect the example to the lesson.

Pro Tips for Better Storytelling
Focus on the Stakes:
The more urgent the stakes, the more engaging the story.
Example: “I had no money and was living in a dangerous neighborhood—I had to find a solution fast.”
Keep It Relatable:
Use problems your audience might face to make the story relevant.
Test and Refine:
Review your retention graph to see where viewers drop off. Adjust your stories and transitions accordingly.


How to Structure a Story
1. The Beginning: Set Up the Problem
Who: Introduce the person the story is about.
What: State the problem they face.
Why: Explain why solving the problem is critical (stakes).
Example:
"I just quit college, had no money, and was living in a back alley in New York’s most dangerous neighborhood. I had to find a way to make cash fast."
Checklist:
Who: The storyteller (you or someone else).
Problem: No money, no home.
Stakes: Dangerous neighborhood, survival depends on solving the problem.

2. The Middle: Show Conflict and Solutions
Conflict: Outline the challenges the person faced when trying to solve the problem.
Solutions: Show how they tackled each obstacle and what they learned.
Engagement Tip: Highlight conflicts your viewers might face so they see themselves in the story.
This can be 90 seconds, 10 seconds, 20 minutes, the length is down to you. But only include information that impacts the final payoff. 
 Ask Point bot to cut down any info in your stories that doesn't impact the payoff 
Example:
"I tried selling my old clothes, but nobody was buying. Then, I discovered an online freelance platform, but I couldn’t get hired until I revamped my profile with these three changes."

3. The End: Deliver the Payoff
Outcome: Did they succeed? What did they learn?
Transformation: Show how they changed by solving the problem—or what they learned from failing.
Retention Tip: Tie the outcome back to the stakes introduced at the start.
Example:
"By following this process, I made enough money to get out of the back alley and rent my first apartment. It wasn’t just about money—it taught me how to create opportunities even when the odds are stacked against me."

Types of Endings
1. The Hero Gets What They Want and What They Need
Description: This is a classic happy ending where the protagonist achieves both their external goal (what they want) and their internal transformation (what they need).
Example:
Titanic: Jack and Rose both survive by sharing the door, living a happy life together.
Why It Works: Audiences love this type of ending because it’s emotionally satisfying and ties up loose ends.
When to Use It: Ideal for stories that are meant to inspire or leave viewers feeling optimistic.

2. The Hero Gets What They Want but Not What They Need
Description: The protagonist achieves their goal but misses out on deeper personal growth or a necessary change. This creates a bittersweet or ironic ending.
Example:
Titanic (Alternate Version): Jack and Rose survive the sinking and begin a life together. But over time, Jack’s free-spirited nature clashes with Rose’s desire for stability, and their relationship falls apart.
Why It Works: This ending feels realistic and adds complexity by showing that getting what you want doesn’t always mean true happiness.
When to Use It: Great for stories that explore human flaws or provide a cautionary tale.

3. The Hero Gets What They Need but Not What They Want
Description: The protagonist sacrifices their goal but gains the growth or transformation they truly needed. This ending often feels bittersweet but meaningful.
Example:
Titanic (Another Version): Jack dies, but Rose survives and goes on to live a full life, finding strength and independence she never knew she had.
Why It Works: This ending emphasizes personal growth and resonates deeply because the hero’s journey feels worth it, even without the external win.
When to Use It: Perfect for stories about resilience, sacrifice, or personal transformation.

4. The Hero Gets Neither (The Greek Tragedy)
Description: The protagonist fails to achieve their goal and doesn’t grow or transform. This creates a tragic ending that leaves the audience reflecting on loss or missed opportunities.
Example:
Titanic (Tragic Version): Jack and Rose both die in the freezing water, leaving behind only the memory of their love.
Romeo and Juliet: Both lovers die due to miscommunication and family conflict.
Why It Works: Tragic endings evoke strong emotions and often carry a powerful moral or lesson.
When to Use It: Best for cautionary tales or when you want to leave a lasting emotional impact.

How to Choose the Right Ending for Your Story
Consider Your Message:
What takeaway do you want your audience to have?
Happy endings inspire; bittersweet endings provoke thought; tragic endings warn or emphasize consequences.


Think About Your Audience:
Will they appreciate a neatly wrapped-up story, or are they more likely to engage with a complex, bittersweet resolution?



How to Find Stories
Personal Experiences: Reflect on challenges you’ve overcome that relate to your audience’s problems.
Client Success Stories: Document the successes of people you’ve helped.
Research Unique Stories: Use AI tools like ChatGPT to uncover true, lesser-known stories.
Prompt Example: “Find a true story about someone who solved [specific problem].”
Social Media & News: Save interesting stories you come across online for future use.
See “Stopy prompts” in the “writing prompts” asset bank for questions that’ll help you find stories 

Common Mistakes to Avoid
Dragging Out Stories:
Delete unnecessary details. Only include what’s essential to the payoff.
Explaining the Point Before the Story:
If you explain the lesson first, the story feels redundant. Lead with the story to hook your audience.
Overloading Details:
Focus on the big picture. Avoid overwhelming viewers with nitty-gritty specifics.

Pro Tips for Better Storytelling
Use Stakes to Build Tension:
The higher the stakes, the more engaging the story.
Engage the Senses:
Describe sights, sounds, and emotions to make the story vivid and immersive.
Keep Practicing:
Storytelling is a skill that improves over time. The more you do it, the better you’ll get.

The South Park Storytelling Formula
To simplify storytelling, follow this structure:
“This Happened”: Set up the problem.
“Therefore”: Show the logical next steps.
“But”: Introduce conflict or complications to keep it interesting.

Next Steps
