🎬 End Brick Guide

The End Brick is where you: 
Set up the next problem or curiosity your viewers have.
Give a clear call-to-action (CTA) to watch another video or take action.
Ensure your video doesn’t "end" but funnels viewers into binge-watching or interacting further.

✨ The Purpose of the End Brick
Keep viewers engaged with your channel.
Increase watch time by directing them to the next video.
Set up a natural flow so viewers don’t drop off.

What videos do you point people back to?
Don't overthink it, just point them back to a video that solves a problem that relates to the video they have just watched 



📋 End Brick Checklist
1. Transition to the End
 Did I introduce a new problem that the next video solves?
 Did I tease the big result of watching the next video?


Example:“You now know how to fix [problem], but if you don’t [solve next issue], it’ll all fall apart, so watch this video next and I’ll show you how to [solve big problem/get big result].”

Checklist:
 Did I tell viewers what to do next?
 Did I say why they should watch it (benefit or result)?
 Did I point them to a specific video?
 Is the End Brick short and to the point? (Under 10 seconds is ideal.)
 Did I avoid unnecessary waffle or extra explanations?
 Did I avoid making it sound like the video was coming to an end?


📝 Example of a Strong End Brick
“The thing is, even though you now know how to create thumbnails that get clicks,  there’s one more thing you need to master because if you don’t it doesnt matter how amaning your images are, they still wont work 
.
So watch this video next where I’ll show you how to write titles that work with your thumbnails to 10x your views.”
