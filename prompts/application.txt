How to Write an Effective Application Brick
The Application Brick is where you turn inspiration into actionable steps, helping your viewers achieve real results. This builds goodwill, trust, and loyalty while cementing the value of your content. Here’s how to create one that works.


Step 1: Transition with Cement
Purpose: Smoothly move from the example brick to the application section.


How: Use a simple line to bridge the gap:
“But how do you do this yourself? Let me show you.”
“Next, let’s break down how you can apply this step by step.”


Why It Matters: A clear transition primes viewers to stay engaged and anticipate actionable value.

Step 2: Make It Big, Easy, and Specific
Avoid Vague Advice:
Bad: “Follow your dreams!”
Good: “Block off one hour a day to work on your dream project.”


Hit the Sweet Spot:


Big: Show steps that make a meaningful difference.
Easy: Make it feel achievable.
Specific: Provide clear instructions.

Step 3: Break It Down
Slice Big Tasks: Break overwhelming tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
Example: You wouldn’t eat a loaf of bread whole—you’d slice it up.


Use a Framework:
Numbered steps.
Visual props.
Roadmaps or charts.


Test Simplicity: Ask yourself, “Could my nan follow this?” (Your nan, not Ed’s—she’s unavailable.)

Step 4: Match Depth to Your Audience
Beginners: Simplify with clear frameworks and basic steps.
Experts: Offer nuanced insights and detailed explanations.
Err on the Side of Simplicity: Beginners often underestimate their lack of knowledge, so keep it accessible even if they consider themselves “advanced.”

Step 5: Show, Don’t Just Tell
Why It Works: The more you visually demonstrate steps, the easier it is for viewers to follow.
How:
Use visual props, charts, or live demonstrations.
Avoid over-explaining when a visual can do the job.

Step 6: Transition to the Next Brick
Don’t Summarize: Avoid wrapping up the application section too neatly—it can signal to viewers that the video is over.


Set Up the Next Problem: Tease what’s coming next:
“Now that you know how to build trust, let’s tackle the next step: keeping viewers engaged.”

What a Great Application Brick Looks Like
Balanced Length: Some application sections are short and punchy, while others are detailed and comprehensive.
Example 1 (Short): “Even if you're the best in the world, viewers won’t believe it until you show proof of credibility and trustworthiness.”
Example 2 (Long): Step-by-step instructions on creating a trust-building framework.


Result-Oriented: Ensure the steps are actionable and capable of delivering results.

Common Mistakes to Avoid
Being Too Vague: Don’t leave viewers wondering where to start.
Overcomplicating: Simplify advanced concepts for accessibility.
Skipping Visuals: Whenever possible, show your steps to increase understanding.
Leaving Viewers Hanging: Always transition to the next section to maintain engagement.
