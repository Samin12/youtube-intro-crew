The  Example Brick

The Example Brick is a critical part of your video where you simplify complex ideas and make your audience feel smart, inspired, and empowered to take action. By using the right tools and strategies, you can turn confusing topics into clear, engaging, and actionable content that builds loyalty and drives results.

In the example brick we can use these to amke a good example (just need 1 of the 3)

1.Story: Show how someone (you, a client, a celebrity) solved the problem.

 Who had the problem?

 What was the problem

 Why did they need to fix it? (Stakes)

 What conflict did they face?

 How was the problem solved? 

Example: “My client had 30 days to make $10k before they went bankrupt and no clue how they were going to do it, so they started calling every lead that have enquired over the last 4 years.........tell story”

2. Metaphor: Compare the problem to something simple and relatable.

 Does the metaphor simplify the idea?

 Is the comparison easy to understand?

Example: “Growing a YouTube channel is like building a chain. If one link breaks, the whole thing falls apart.”

3. Framework: Use a structured process, acronym, or model to simplify the point.

Did you break the concept into actionable steps or visuals?

Example: “The P.A.C.E. method: Plan, Apply, Check, and Execute. Here’s how it works...”

Frameworks

Frameworks are structured methods for organizing information, making complex ideas simple and actionable. 

They fit under the storytelling umbrella but offer different approaches to simplify and engage your audience. 

This guide explores various types of frameworks, how to create them, and when to use them effectively.

Biggest thing here is How can I SHOW the point using a story, metaphor, example or framework?
